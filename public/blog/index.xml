      <description>Camp Kesem is a non-profit organzation where we provide a week long of free camp for children whose parents have been affected by cancer. I had the most amazing opportunity to become a camp counselor this past summer where I served as a counselor for ages 6-8 (the littlest of the bunch!). The experience was truly eye-opening and made me want to consider a career where I was able to work with and interact with kids.</description>
