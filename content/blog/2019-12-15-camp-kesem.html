<p>Camp Kesem is a non-profit organzation where we provide a week long of free camp for children whose parents have been affected by cancer. I had the most amazing opportunity to become a camp counselor this past summer where I served as a counselor for ages 6-8 (the littlest of the bunch!). The experience was truly eye-opening and made me want to consider a career where I was able to work with and interact with kids. We often overlook the issues that kids go through when dealing with their parents cancer and with Camp Kesem they are able to become whoever they want to be and feel safe. Camp Kesem is a safe haven for them to have fun, let loose, and become a kid because often they are not able to have the experiences that most kids have their age.</p>
<p>One of my campers Sharktooth, as we are able to come up with our own names, was the sweetest (most adorable I have to add) camper we had during camp. He was always so helpful and would always clean the tables after eating and help with little things. One day we told Sharktooth he didn’t have to worry about any of that and he responded, “It’s okay I’m used to helping my parents because they watch my brother.” We found out that Sharktooth also had a brother who was autistic. Sharktooth later told us, “I love camp because I’m able to play with kids like me.” That little remark made me realize what camp was all about. No matter what was going on back home, he was able to enjoy his time here and we were able to provide that for him. A camp full of memories, love, and magic.</p>
<p>This year I’m fundraising 600$ and I hope you can donate to my page to help make some magic at camp!
